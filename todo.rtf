	- change default step_by back to 1\
	- make sure that it looks OK on mobile\

\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf2 	- use a smaller logo?\
	- is there something wrong with alignment?\
	  try using std html5?\
\'95\'a0Padding and alignment is a little messed up on mobile.\

	- record how many people started/finished\
	- whether they ruined it, were denied, or allowed\
	- maybe count settings as well\
	- optional comment\
